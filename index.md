1. One aspect of technology that has had a great impact on society is how it affects learning. Itâ€™s made learning more interactive and collaborative, this helps people better engage with the material that they are learning and have trouble with. Another way technology has impacted society is through communication, how we can easily and quickly communicate with one another worldwide. It also allows for the easier access of information worldwide. Some of the negative effects of computers are human's break their social interact with friends and families, cause mental health problems like depression, and poor physical health. Computer addiction is really dangerous to our lives and has consequences that can affect academic performance as well.


2. Dopamine is a real issue especially in teenagers who can't control their screen time. When students feel stressed or want to take a break from their academic work, they turn to video games or social media, both of which are related to dopamine.

1. Someone can empower themself in a digital world by confidently participating in the digital world. For example, on social media, people can gain countless followers by posting content that appeals to their audience.

2. Someone can empower someone else by inspiring them and giving them guidancde. Something I could do at Del Norte HS is giving words of encouragement or even giving constructive feedback to those who are not empowered or not confident, so that they feel moved, encouraged, supported, and grow to become more motivated and confident.

3. Red tape is defined as a lot of official forms and procedures that are involved before something is accomplished. I think it can affect digital empowerment as individuals may feel overwhelmed by the amount of red tape before they even access something that allows them to empower themselves in the digital world. I There are such barriers at Del Norte. For example, students have to get tons of signatures and fill out numerous forms just to take or drop a course of their choice. Red tape is particularly burdensome to smaller businesses. Smaller businesses can drown in a sea of red tape, as there are so many requirements and documents that they have to follow before they start up their business.
