# 5.5 Github Actions
1. License preferred by a community: Apache License 2.0, GNU GPLv3, MIT, or the very similar ISC licenses. Simple and permissive license: The MIT License is short and to the point. It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, like making and distributing closed source versions. Sharing improvements: The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. Non-software licenses: CC0-1.0, CC-BY-4.0, and CC-BY-SA-4.0 are open licenses used for non-software material ranging from datasets to videos.
2. I made a license for my personal project. I picked the Apache License 2.0 because it permits commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use.
