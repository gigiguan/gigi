1. One aspect of technology that has had a great impact on society is how it affects learning. It’s made learning more interactive and collaborative, this helps people better engage with the material that they are learning and have trouble with. Another way technology has impacted society is through communication, how we can easily and quickly communicate with one another worldwide. It also allows for the easier access of information worldwide. Some of the negative effects of computers are human's break their social interact with friends and families, cause mental health problems like depression, and poor physical health. Computer addiction is really dangerous to our lives and has consequences that can affect academic performance as well.


2. Dopamine is a real issue especially in teenagers who can't control their screen time. When students feel stressed or want to take a break from their academic work, they turn to video games or social media, both of which are related to dopamine. When teens feel pleasure playing video games or scrolling through social media, they tend to forget about time and this affects their academic performance and sleep as well.

1. Someone can empower themself in a digital world by confidently participating in the digital world. For example, on social media, people can gain countless followers by posting content that appeals to their audience. Considering another example, people who have extraordinary gaming skills can empower themself in the digital gaming world. I think digital empowerment means to maximize personal potential through digital technology.

2. Someone can empower someone else by inspiring them and giving them guidancde. Something I could do at Del Norte HS is giving words of encouragement or even giving constructive feedback to those who are not empowered or not confident, so that they feel moved, encouraged, supported, and grow to become more motivated and confident.

3. Red tape is defined as a lot of official forms and procedures that are involved before something is accomplished. I think it can affect digital empowerment as individuals may feel overwhelmed by the amount of red tape before they even access something that allows them to empower themselves in the digital world. I There are such barriers at Del Norte. For example, students have to get tons of signatures and fill out numerous forms just to take or drop a course of their choice. Red tape is particularly burdensome to smaller businesses. Smaller businesses can drown in a sea of red tape, as there are so many requirements and documents that they have to follow before they start up their business. 

### 5.3
1. The owner of the computer does think this was intentional because he stated firmly that he thinks HP computers are racist.
2. This might have happened because the developer team of HP computers are not diverse enough. A diverse developer team is necessary to prevent computer bias.
3. This is harmful because users are experiencing unfair treatments regarding the facial recognition scan. However, it probably wasn't intended to be harmful or exclude. It's just that the developer team are not diverse enough to realize potential biases evident among them.
4. It should be corrected because every user deserves to experience the same experience regardless of their differences. 
5. To produce a better outcome, we need to create developer teams that are diverse in every aspect, from ethnicity to gender, to account for all possible differences of the users.

### 5.4
1. A crowdsrouce idea for CompSci's 150 principles students is a "Design My Ideal CSP Class" app. This app would allow students to design how they would want the class to go and create their very own CSP-related activities. Then, teachers could use the ideas that these students submitted in the app as inspiration for how they can teach the class next year.
2. Our final project is a website to spread awareness about mental health. Our final project could be better with crowdsourcing. For example, we can prompt the user to answer questions upon opening our website, perhaps about how stressful they're feeling and the cause of their stress/mental illness. This would allow us to better understand the problem underlying our campus so we can refine our website to include more features targetting differenct causes of mental illness/stress to benefit as many students as possible.

### 5.5
1. License preferred by a community: Apache License 2.0, GNU GPLv3, MIT, or the very similar ISC licenses. Simple and permissive license: The MIT License is short and to the point. It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, like making and distributing closed source versions. Sharing improvements: The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. Non-software licenses: CC0-1.0, CC-BY-4.0, and CC-BY-SA-4.0 are open licenses used for non-software material ranging from datasets to videos.
2. I made a license for my personal project. I picked the Apache License 2.0 because it permits commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use. 

### 5.6
1. I've seen PII on our projects in CSP on our about me pages where we revealed our names, email, and picture (toggle masks). These things can be known by everyone because everyone can access our deployed website.
2. Some PII needs to stay absolutely secret, such as our social security numbers or credit card numbers, while some can be revealed to public, such as our name and email. We need to be aware of what information we're giving online. For example, if an online organization suffers a data breach, a significant concern is what PII might be exposed—the personal data of the customers that do business or otherwise interact with the entity. Exposed PII can be sold on the dark web and used to commit identity theft, putting the customers at risk.
3. Good passwords include numbers, capitlized and lower case letters, as well as special characters, in more than 8 characters. Bad passwords are those that have a pattern or does not have complexity such as 12345. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is secondary verification/two-step authentication. For example, some platforms may ask for an email or phone number code verification after the user enters their password.
4. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data making it very easy to use. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt information.
5. An example we use in deployment is the key .pem file. I use Amazon AWS to deploy and when I create my EC2 instance on AWS, it creates a .pem file for me that I can use as an identification key to allow me to access my instance everytime I want to deploy. The .pem file is only accessible by me and can only be downloaded once. This prevents other users from connceting to my instance.
6. The most basic phishing scheme I have learned about is deceptive phishing. In this scheme, attackers impersonate a legitimate company to steal people's personal data or login credentials. They send emails that use threats and create a sense of urgency to scare users into doing what the attackers want. Some other phishing techniques include spear phishing and whaling. Spear phishing is when attackers customize their attack emails with the target’s name, position, company, work phone number, and other information to trick the recipient into believing that they have a connection with the sender, but their ultimate goal is the same as deceptive phishing. Whaling is a CEO fraud targetting executives.
