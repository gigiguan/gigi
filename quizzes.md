### **Quiz 5: Score 42/50**
**Q4 What can be represented with a single binary digit**

Which of the following can be represented by a single binary digit?

A: The remainder when dividing a whole number by 2; The value of a Boolean variable
* Explanation: When dividing a whole number (0, 1, 2, 3, …) by 2, the remainder will always be 0 or 1. A binary digit, by its definition, stores 0 or 1.; The volume of a car radio can have many possible values between the lowest possible setting and the highest
possible setting. Binary digits can only store two possible values: 0 or 1.
* Reflection: The volume of car radio is incorrect because the volume of a car radio can have many possible values between the lowest possible setting and the highest possible setting. Binary digits can only store two possible values: 0 or 1.

A: Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ.
* Explanation: The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the
corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
* Reflection: Program A and program B display a different number of values is incorrect; Both programs display ten values.

**Q21 Video-streaming Web site uses 32-bit integer**

A video-streaming Web site uses 32-bit integers to count the number of times each video has been played. In anticipation of some videos being played more times than can be represented with 32 bits, the Web site is planning to change to 64-bit integers for the counter. Which of the following best describes the result of using 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers?

A: 2^32 times as many values can be represented.

* Explanation: Bit integer always 2 to the power of the number.

**Q27 Demonstrate a problem is undecidable**

A student wants to determine whether a certain problem is undecidable. Which of the following will demonstrate that the problem is undecidable?

A: Show that for one instance of the problem, no algorithm can be written that is capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.
* Explanation: A decidable problem is one for which an algorithm can be constructed to produce a correct output for all inputs. If, for one instance of the problem, this is not possible, then this problem cannot be decidable. Therefore, it must be undecidable.
* Reflection: The statement "Show that for one instance of the problem, a heuristic is needed to write an algorithm that is capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer" does not provide enough information to conclude that the problem is undecidable. This states that a heuristic is used for one instance of the problem. If it could be shown that an algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer for all other instances of this problem, then this problem would be decidable.

**Q35 True statement about the network **

The figure below represents a network of physically linked devices labeled A through I. A line between two devices indicates that the devices can communicate directly with each other. Any information sent between two devices that are not directly connected must go through at least one other device. For example, in the network represented below, information can be sent directly between A and B, but information sent between devices A and G must go through other devices.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219495/167029411-83557749-ce0f-47da-81af-fe1aaebcf9da.png)

Which of the following statements is true about the network?

A: If devices B and F fail, then device A will not be able to communicate with device G.
* Explanation: If devices B and F fail, then devices E, G, and H will become isolated from devices A, C, D, and I. Therefore, device A will be unable to communicate with device G.
* Reflection: "Information sent from device A to device D can use at most two unique paths." is incorrect because there are many possible paths between devices A and D, including A-B-D, A-C-D, A-C-F-D, and A-B-E-F-D.

**Q36 Transfer a file on a Web server**

A user enters a Web address in a browser, and a request for a file is sent to a Web server. Which of the following best describes how the file is sent to the user?

A: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The packets must be reassembled upon receipt.
* Explanation: Digital data on the Internet is sent by breaking data into blocks of bits called packets. The packets are reassembled by the user’s computer.
* Reflection: "The server attempts to connect directly to the user’s computer. If the connection is successful, the entire file is sent. If the connection is unsuccessful, an error message is sent to the user." is incorrec because the server does not attempt to connect directly to the user’s computer. Rather, packets are sent via routers, and the packets may take different paths to get to the user’s computer. If one packet’s journey to the user is unsuccessful, that packet is resent by the server.

**Q43 True statement about the Internet**

Which of the following statements about the Internet is true?

A: The Internet is designed to scale to support an increasing number of users.
* Explanation: The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network.
* Reflection: "The Internet is a computer network that uses proprietary communication protocols." is incorrect. The Internet uses standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols.

**Q48 Role of certificate authorities **

Which of the following best explains how a certificate authority is used in protecting data?

A: A **certificate authority** verifies the authenticity of encryption keys used in secured communications.
* Explanation: Certificate authorities are entities that issue digital certificates, which are used to certify the ownership of public keys.
* Reflection: Certificate authorities do not verify the safety of Web sites.


### **Quiz 3: Score 41/50**
**Q7 Result of iteration statements**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219495/165630253-946768b3-7b2a-4e96-a813-f982c26a7361.png)

Which of the following best describes the value returned by the procedure?

A: The procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
* Explanation: The procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j, or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
* Reflection: The answer is not "the procedure returns the value of 2 * n" because the procedure does not return the value of 2 * n. For a procedure to return 2 * n, it could initialize result to 0 and then repeatedly add 2 to result a total of n times.

**Q9 Apartment rental Web site flowchart**

A flowchart is a way to visually represent an algorithm. The flowchart below is used by an apartment rental Web site to set the variable include to true for apartments that meet certain criteria.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219495/165849224-b2ab8a6b-ecac-4415-b361-78a40c9e12dd.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219495/165849386-c62097f0-5c57-4050-b255-5016e116e96d.png)

Which of the following statements is equivalent to the algorithm in the flowchart?

A: include <- (floor > 10) OR (bedrooms = 3)
* Explanation: The flowchart sets include to true whenever floor is greater than 1 0 or bedrooms equal 3, and sets include to false otherwise. Therefore, the algorithm is equivalent to include <- (floor > 10) OR (bedrooms = 3).
* Reflection: The answer is not include <- (floor > 10) AND (bedrooms = 3) because this expression would be used for a flowchart to set include to true whenever floor is greater than 1 0 and bedrooms equal 3. This does not correctly set include to true in cases where only one of the two conditions is true.

**Q17 Test cases for procedure Smallest**

The procedure Smallest is intended to return the least value in the list numbers. The procedure does not work as intended.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219495/165849897-b5c83989-a783-4f2c-81af-f1d4742e8085.png)

For which of the following values of the List will Smallest(the List) NOT return the intended value? Select two answers.

A: theList <- [30, 40, 20, 10] and theList <- [40, 30, 20, 10]
* Explanation: The procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list [30, 40, 20, 10], the procedure returns 20, which is not the least value in the list. Also, the procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list [40, 30, 20, 10], the procedure returns 30, which is not the least value in the list.
* Reflection: I did not see the part of the question that says "Select two answers". I only chose one answer. I need to remember to read every question thoroughly.


**Q21 Use of weak passwords**

Which of the following best explains how devices and information can be susceptible to unauthorized access if weak passwords are used?

A: Unauthorized individuals can use data mining and other techniques to guess a user’s password.

* Explanation: A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. Weak passwords can often be guessed based on publicly available information about a user. Other weak passwords (such as "password" or "1234") can often be guessed because they are commonly used.
* Reflection: THe answer is not that unauthorized individuals can exploit vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms to determine a user’s password from their encryption key because the exploitation of encryption algorithms is not related to password strength.

**Q35 Consequences of downloading licensed music seller**

A user reads reviews of a popular artist’s new album and then downloads the album from the Web site of a licensed online music seller. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be a consequence of this action?

A: The user will be in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
* Explanation: If the album was purchased and downloaded through a licensed music store, the user will not be in violation of the DMCA.
* Reflection: The choice "Album reviews from other people who live nearby will be displayed to the user." is incorrect because geolocation data can be accessed by the Web site, which can use this information to provide album reviews from nearby users.


**Q41 Encrypting and decrypting using public key cryptography**

In public key cryptography, the sender uses the recipient’s public key to encrypt a message. Which of the following is needed to decrypt the message?

A: The recipient’s private key
* Explanation: In public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key.
* Reflection: The sender’s public key cannot be used to decrypt the message.

**Q42 Number of bits needed for item inventory**

A store uses binary numbers to assign a unique binary sequence to each item in its inventory. What is the minimum number of bits required for each binary sequence if the store has between 75 and 100 items in its inventory?

A: 7
* Explanation: Using 6 bits will only allow for up to 64 sequences because 2^6=64. Using 7 bits will allow for up to 128 sequences because 2^7=128. Therefore, a minimum of 7 bits are needed.
* Reflection: Using 6 bits will only allow for up to 64 sequences because 2^6=64 but 100 items are needed.

**Q44 Abstraction with procedures Square and Cube**

A programmer notices the following two procedures in a library. The procedures do similar, but not identical, things.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219495/165868217-bcc33146-b694-4d67-972f-5509f5d6e238.png)

Which of the following procedures is a generalization of the procedures described above?

A: Procedure Power(n, m), which returns the value n^m
* Explanation: The procedures square and cube are each used to determine a power of n. A generalization of this procedure
is Power(n, m), which calculates n raised to the m power.
* Reflection: Polynomial(n) calculates the sum of the square and cube procedures, but does not generalize their functionality to calcualte the power of n.


**Q46 Examples of symmetric encryption**

Which of the following is an example of symmetric encryption?

A: Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key. Finn uses the key to write a message to Gwen where each letter is replaced with the corresponding symbol. Gwen uses the key to map each symbol back to the original letter.
* Explanation: This is an example of symmetric encryption because the secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of messages.
* Reflection: "Evy buys a locked box that operates using two different codes. When the first code is entered, a slot opens that allows a message to be put in the box. When the second code is entered, the door to the box opens. Evy gives the first code to her friends so they can leave messages for her and keeps the second code to herself so that she is the only one who can retrieve the messages." is incorrect because this is an example of an asymmetric system because different codes are used to send and receive messages.

**Other topics to review/Additional notes:**

**Q14**: An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences?

A: 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
* Reflection: Using 6-bit binary sequences allows for 26 or 64 different items to be identified. Using 7-bit binary sequences allows for 27 or 128 different items to be identified. Thus there are two times as many items that can be uniquely identified.

**Q20 Collections of books to be combined**

A: 

newList ← Combine (list1, list2)

newList ← Sort (newList)

newList ← RemoveDuplicates (newList)

* Reflection: When list1 and list2 are combined, the newList may have duplicates and will likely not be sorted. Performing the Sort and then the RemoveDuplicates procedures will result in a list that is sorted, has no duplicates, and contains the names of all the books found in either list1 or list2.

**Q23**: Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy?

A: A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser
