A: The company can analyze the calling session data and thereby make better business decisions.
* Storing information about each call will increase the amount of data storage needed, which is likely to increase the need for data compression.
* By storing information about each call, the company can use machine learning and data mining and thereby make business decisions based on their customers’ needs.

A: Do the movement patterns of the animal vary according to the weather?

Q14: An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences?
A: 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
* Using 6-bit binary sequences allows for 26 or 64 different items to be identified. Using 7-bit binary sequences allows for 27 or 128 different items to be identified. Thus there are two times as many items that can be uniquely identified.

Q20 Collections of books to be combined

A: 

newList ← Combine (list1, list2)

newList ← Sort (newList)

newList ← RemoveDuplicates (newList)

* When list1 and list2 are combined, the newList may have duplicates and will likely not be sorted. Performing the Sort and then the RemoveDuplicates procedures will result in a list that is sorted, has no duplicates, and contains the names of all the books found in either list1 or list2.

Q23: Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy?
A: A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser
* The aggregation of information in browser cookies can be used by websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user.

Q28: Which of the following is a true statement about data compression?
A: There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.

Q32: Error in countNumOccurences procedure

A: Moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3

A: x = 3, y = 2, z = 1

Q39: minimize execution time using parallel computing

A: Take the two shortest execution times and add them - 30+50=80 seconds

### **Quiz 2: Score 46/50**

Q7 Advantage of lossless over lossy compression
* Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm?
* A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.
* Lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not.

Q8 Advantages of open source software
* Which of the following is NOT an advantage of using open-source software?
* The original developer of open-source software provides free or low-cost support for users installing and running the software.
* Open-source software has source code that is released under a license that allows users the rights to use and distribute it. However, there is no guarantee that the original developer of open-source software will provide support for its users.

Q45 Combine data sources

* Spreadsheets I and II
* The desired information can be determined by using the student IDs in spreadsheet II to identify the students who play a sport. Once the students who play a sport are identified, the grade point averages of students who play sports in spreadsheet I can be compared to the grade point averages of all other students in spreadsheet I.

Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossless transformation because an encoded string can be restored to its original version.
