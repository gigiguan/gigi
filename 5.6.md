# 5.6 Github Actions
1. I've seen PII on our projects in CSP on our about me pages where we revealed our names, email, and picture (toggle masks). These things can be known by everyone because everyone can access our deployed website.
2. Some PII needs to stay absolutely secret, such as our social security numbers or credit card numbers, while some can be revealed to public, such as our name and email. We need to be aware of what information we're giving online. For example, if an online organization suffers a data breach, a significant concern is what PII might be exposed—the personal data of the customers that do business or otherwise interact with the entity. Exposed PII can be sold on the dark web and used to commit identity theft, putting the customers at risk.
3. Good passwords include numbers, capitlized and lower case letters, as well as special characters, in more than 8 characters. Bad passwords are those that have a pattern or does not have complexity such as 12345. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is secondary verification/two-step authentication. For example, some platforms may ask for an email or phone number code verification after the user enters their password.
4. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data making it very easy to use. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt information.
5. An example we use in deployment is the key .pem file. I use Amazon AWS to deploy and when I create my EC2 instance on AWS, it creates a .pem file for me that I can use as an identification key to allow me to access my instance everytime I want to deploy. The .pem file is only accessible by me and can only be downloaded once. This prevents other users from connceting to my instance.
6. The most basic phishing scheme I have learned about is deceptive phishing. In this scheme, attackers impersonate a legitimate company to steal people's personal data or login credentials. They send emails that use threats and create a sense of urgency to scare users into doing what the attackers want. Some other phishing techniques include spear phishing and whaling. Spear phishing is when attackers customize their attack emails with the target’s name, position, company, work phone number, and other information to trick the recipient into believing that they have a connection with the sender, but their ultimate goal is the same as deceptive phishing. Whaling is a CEO fraud targetting executives.
